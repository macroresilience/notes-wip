Early Chan properly understood is an argument to not take the stories and categorisation of the left brain too seriously (ref No Self, No Problem)

> The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences.  When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised.  Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart. If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinions for, or against, anything.  To set up what you like against what you dislike is the disease of the mind.  When the deep meaning of things is not understood, the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.

we can see the difference between early Chan and later Zen. early Chan understands (correctly IMO) that passivity and peace of mind attained on the meditation cushion is of limited value in the active real world.

> Live neither in the entanglements of outer things, nor in inner feelings of emptiness...When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity, your very effort fills you with activity. 

> The more you talk and think about it, the further astray you wander from the truth.  Stop talking and thinking, and there is nothing you will not be able to know.

> Do not search for the truth; only cease to cherish opinions.

> Even to be attached to the idea of enlightenment is to go astray.

> the burdensome practice of judging brings annoyance and weariness. 

> The wise man strives to no goals, but the foolish man fetters himself.

The influence of Taoism is of course all over Chan Buddhism and if you believe Victor Mair, Hinduism as well via Taoism. The emphasis against self-centered striving would not be out of place in the Bhagavad Gita.

> For the unified mind in accord with the Way, all self-centered striving ceases.

> Infinitely large and infinitely small; no difference, for definitions have vanished and no boundaries are seen.
