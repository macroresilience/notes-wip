The Eight Precepts of Buddhism forbids listening to music and as my meditation practice has deepened, I can understand the reason for this. As someone who has listened to a lot of music, I now realise that I am almost constantly singing some song in the background noise of my mind. This is clearly not optimal for progress in meditation. 

However, although such denial makes sense for a monk, it is unclear whether it makes sense for those of us who would like to remain in an awakened state within the maelstrom of the real world where we can't control our surroundings and what may assault our senses.

Early Chan Buddhism understood this hence the warnings against over-reliance on the meditation cushion in works such as the [[xinxin-ming]].
